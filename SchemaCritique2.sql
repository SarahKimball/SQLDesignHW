
-- One way to improve this is to add foreign keys to the "tickets" table, linking it to other tables in the database that contain related information. For example, if there is a table called "flights" that contains information about each flight (such as the flight number and airline), you could add a foreign key to the "tickets" table that references the corresponding flight.

-- To add a foreign key to the "tickets" table, you can use the following SQL statement:

Command

ALTER TABLE tickets
ADD COLUMN flight_id INTEGER REFERENCES flights(id);


-- This statement adds a new column to the "tickets" table called "flight_id", which is defined as an integer data type. The REFERENCES clause specifies that this column references the "id" column in the "flights" table. This creates a foreign key constraint that ensures that every value in the "flight_id" column of the "tickets" table corresponds to a valid value in the "id" column of the "flights" table.

Other additions: 

-- Add indexes: If you frequently query the "tickets" table based on certain columns, such as "departure" or "airline", consider adding indexes to those columns. This can improve query performance by allowing the database to quickly find the rows that match your query.

CREATE INDEX tickets_departure_idx ON tickets (departure);
CREATE INDEX tickets_airline_idx ON tickets (airline);


-- Normalize data: If you have columns in the "tickets" table that contain repeating or multi-valued data (such as "from_city" and "from_country"), consider normalizing the data by creating separate tables for each distinct value and linking them together using foreign keys. This can help reduce data duplication and improve data consistency.

-- Add constraints: If there are any rules or restrictions on the data in the "tickets" table that are not already enforced by the data types or foreign key constraints, consider adding additional constraints to ensure data integrity. For example, you could add a CHECK constraint to ensure that the "departure" timestamp is always before the "arrival" timestamp.

ALTER TABLE tickets
ADD CONSTRAINT departure_before_arrival CHECK (departure < arrival);
